A collection of restaurants that satisfy our weird eating habits

## San Mateo


##### Amicis

Brick oven pizza, lots of herbs and grease, very thin, blackened edge crispy crust. It's the closest to Flatbread that we've found, but expensive and the sauce is a minefield.

##### New York Pizza

Gigantic slices that are covered in grease and are delicious.  One slice is really 2, and is enough to fill you up.

##### Howie's Artisan Pizza

Woodfired pizza.  Don't trust the margharita name, just ask for cheese pizza.  The sauce is good and has some unique spices in it.
