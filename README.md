A collection of restaurants that satisfy our weird eating habits


California
-----------

##### Ravioli House

Amazing cheese ravioli, small square shape. Their sauce has a weird aftertaste to it, but they sell frozen ravioli you can make at home and use your own sauce. Prego Traditional, Heart Smart Traditional, or Light Smart Traditional sauce is the best now that Healthy Choice is discontinued.

##### New York Pizza

Gigantic slices that are covered in grease and are delicious. One slice is really 2, and is enough to fill you up.

##### Amici's

Brick oven pizza, lots of herbs and grease, very thin, blackened edge crispy crust. It's the closest to Flatbread that we've found, but expensive and the sauce is a minefield.

##### Howie's Artisan Pizza

Woodfired pizza. Don't trust the margharita name, just ask for cheese pizza. The sauce is good and has some unique spices in it. Really light pizza, good for lunch or if you're not as hungry. Amazing lemonade! Terrible root beer.

##### Uncle Vito's

Great pizza with excellent sauce, completely smooth, no chunks at all. A little small. Really good crust. Their garlic bread and ravioli are really good too.

##### Oregano's

Almost no sauce, really flour-y dough, salty cheese. Small personal pizzas and slices. Their ravioli is also really good, but it's orange sauce.



##### Pasta Market

Same plaza as Oregano's, next door. Home made pasta. We don't remember it very well..



##### Kingfish

Downtown San Mateo, mostly a wine place, a little fancier than most of our favorites. Home made pasta and their pizza are both good.



Buffalo
-------


##### Pizza Plant

Pods. The greatest relative of the calzone ever to grace the planet. Restaurant god-tier. We could eat here every day. Don't bother with any of the pastas on the menu though, it's definitely not their specialty.

##### La Bella Sicilia

Everything here is amazing. Pizza doesn't look like it will taste good bet it's incredible. All the pastas are basically the same, and awesome- shells, manicotti, ravioli, etc. all with lots of sauce and melted cheese on top.



##### Great Northern Pizza Kitchen

Macaroni and cheese pizza. Some kind of thin white sauce, ziti, and melted cheddar cheese on pizza crust. Really good, but definitely something you have to be in the mood for. Their regular cheese pizza is pretty decent too.

Rochester
-----------


##### Zonie's

Okay calzones, nothing too impressive. They're open until like 4am, so if it's late in Rochester and you're hungry this is the place to go.



Maine
-----------


##### Flatbread Pizza Company

Jay's Heart, their basic cheese, is the best pizza on earth. Even though it is made by crazy organic hippies. It's brick-oven fired, lots of green, lots of grease. If you can eat dessert, they have a warm brownie with vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, and sprinkled cinnamon that's amazing. Their locally made crap soda brand is drinkable, but bland.
