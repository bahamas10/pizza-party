A collection of restaurants that satisfy our weird eating habits



California
-----------

##### Ravioli House

Amazing cheese ravioli, small square shape. Their sauce has a weird aftertaste to it, but they sell frozen ravioli you can make at home and use your own sauce. Prego Traditional, Heart Smart Traditional, or Light Smart Traditional sauce is the best now that Healthy Choice is discontinued.


##### Amicis

Brick oven pizza, lots of herbs and grease, very thin, blackened edge crispy crust. It's the closest to Flatbread that we've found, but expensive and the sauce is a minefield.

##### New York Pizza

Gigantic slices that are covered in grease and are delicious. One slice is really 2, and is enough to fill you up.



##### Howie's Artisan Pizza

Woodfired pizza. Don't trust the margharita name, just ask for cheese pizza. The sauce is good and has some unique spices in it. Really light pizza, good for lunch or if you're not as hungry. Amazing lemonade! Terrible root beer.

##### Oregano's

Almost no sauce, really flour-y dough, salty cheese. Small personal pizzas and slices. Their ravioli is also really good, but it's orange sauce.



##### Pasta Market

Same plaza as Oregano's, next door. We don't remember it very well..



##### Uncle Vito's

Great pizza with excellent sauce. A little small.
